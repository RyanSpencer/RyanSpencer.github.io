		<p>I chose this topic because it was something I was very interested in, to the 
		point where I will be presenting on the same topic at a panel during ToraCon in April. 
		I will also be applying to run the same panel at Otakon in Baltimore during August.</p>
		<p>A lot of my special work was done on color scheme, I spent a lot of time working 
		on getting a color scheme that was interesting but also appealing to the eye.I also
		had all the links available on a separate page for straight info, with a printable version</p>
		<p>I wanted to make the nav bar stick to the top of the screen but when I jumped from 
		section to section it would jump in a way that covered up the title of the step. 
		I would have liked to do this but do it right. Also not doing the entire website
		by coding for almost 12 hours straight. </p>
